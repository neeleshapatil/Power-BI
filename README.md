# Power-BI
## Dataflows
Power BI Dataflow is the data transformation component in Power BI. It is a Power Query process that runs in the cloud, independent from Power BI report and dataset, and store the data into CDM: Common Data Model inside Azure Data Lake storage. 
- More consistency between datasets â€“ less chance that different users will make different decisions when preparing data
- Removes the necessity for individual data source prep and provides ETL

## Create a dataflow using linked tables
Creating a dataflow using linked tables enables you to reference an existing table, defined in another dataflow, in a read-only fashion. Some of the reasons you may choose this approach:

- If you want to reuse a table across multiple dataflows, such as a date table or a static lookup table, you should create a table once and then reference it across the other dataflows.

- If you want to avoid creating multiple refreshes to a data source, it's better to use linked tables to store the data and act as a cache. Doing so allows every subsequent consumer to leverage that table, reducing the load to the underlying data source.

- If you need to perform a merge between two tables.
